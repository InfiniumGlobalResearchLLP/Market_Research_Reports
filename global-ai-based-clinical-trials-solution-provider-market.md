<p><strong>AI Transforming Clinical Trials</strong></p>
<p>The transformation of clinical trials with AI starts from the very beginning, with AI assisting in protocol development. It can also replace or refine how treatment outcomes are measured, using methods that are more sensitive to change than traditional ones. Additionally, AI enables the use of remote technologies that reduce the need for patients to travel long distances for check-ups. This is just one example of how AI streamlines clinical trial operations.</p>
<p><strong>AI's Potential to Revolutionize Drug Development</strong></p>
<p>The potential of AI to improve efficiency and lower costs in clinical development is gaining recognition. AI can unlock valuable insights from a vast amount of data sources, including medical records, disease registries, and scientific literature. This allows for faster and more targeted patient recruitment for trials.</p>
<p><strong>COVID-19 and the Rise of AI in Clinical Trials</strong></p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated the adoption of AI-based technologies in clinical trials. A key driver during this time was the rise of sophisticated solutions for finding, collecting, and analyzing data from enrolled patients.</p>
<p><strong>Innovation and Collaboration Fueling Market Growth</strong></p>
<p>Looking ahead, the market is expected to be propelled by the constant innovation coming from leading players in the field. Their efforts to develop new and advanced technologies and products will fuel significant growth over the coming years. This growth will be further bolstered by the increasing use of AI-based solutions for clinical trials in general, along with its specific application in mutant detection during pandemics. However, stringent regulations surrounding the approval of AI-based solutions in clinical trials pose a potential hurdle to market growth.</p>
<p>On a brighter note, a growing number of collaborations focused on applying AI in clinical trials are underway. These collaborations aim to reduce the time and financial burden associated with clinical development phases, creating promising opportunities for market expansion in the forecast period.</p>
