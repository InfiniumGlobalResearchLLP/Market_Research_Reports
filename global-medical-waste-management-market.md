<p><strong>Understanding Medical Waste Management</strong></p>
<p>Medical waste management refers to the proper handling and disposal of solid or liquid waste generated during healthcare activities. This waste comes from hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, nursing homes, and other healthcare facilities. Incineration is a common method for treating this waste, but effective segregation is crucial. Improper segregation risks even small amounts of hazardous materials contaminating large volumes of waste. The market for medical waste management is expected to grow significantly due to several factors. These include an aging population requiring more healthcare, rising use of advanced medical technologies, and stricter regulations mandating safe and environmentally friendly disposal practices.</p>

<p>The global medical waste management market is fragmented, with a mix of established waste management giants and new players emerging. Favorable government regulations, research funding, and supportive laws are creating opportunities for new entrants. However, the market also faces challenges. The threat of substitute products and intense competition among existing players could potentially hinder market growth.</p>
