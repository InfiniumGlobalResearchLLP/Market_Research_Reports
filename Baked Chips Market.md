<p><strong>Baked Chips Gaining Popularity as a Healthier Choice</strong></p>
<p>The global baked chips market is estimated to be on an upward trajectory, growing from USD 1.5 billion in 2022 to a projected USD 2.30 billion by 2030, with a steady compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.54%. This growth is primarily driven by health-conscious consumers seeking better-for-you snack alternatives. Baked chips offer a healthier option compared to traditional fried chips due to their baking process and use of sliced vegetables or grains like potatoes, sweet potatoes, and whole grains. This aligns perfectly with the growing trend of healthier eating habits, making baked chips a popular choice for those seeking a balance between taste and nutrition.</p>

As people prioritize convenience, taste, and health in their snack choices, the demand for baked chips continues to rise, stimulating innovation and market expansion within the snack industry. Another contributing factor is the increasing adoption of vegan and plant-based diets. Consumers seeking cruelty-free and sustainable options are fueling market growth, as baked chips, often made from plant-based ingredients, cater to this demand for ethical and environmentally conscious food choices.</p>
<p><strong>Traditional Chips Remain a Challenge, Innovation is Key</strong></p>

To overcome this, the market can capitalize on further promoting the health benefits of baked chips to capitalize on the existing demand for nutritious snacking.
