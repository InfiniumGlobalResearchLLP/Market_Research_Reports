<p><strong>Bio-based Elastomers: A Sustainable Future for Construction</strong></p>
<p>Bio-based elastomers, made from sustainable materials like vegetable oils, are expected to be a key growth driver, especially in developing countries. These eco-friendly alternatives offer similar performance benefits to traditional elastomers used in construction, hardware, and footwear. Their biodegradability reduces reliance on non-sustainable resources, and ongoing advancements are creating exciting opportunities for manufacturers. Additionally, a focus on environmentally friendly products is leading to the development of climate-conscious elastomers.</p>
<p><strong>Why Elastomers Rule Construction</strong></p>
<p>Elastomers' inherent properties like impact strength, resilience, elongation, tear resistance, and abrasion resistance make them highly valuable in construction. They are used in climate stripping, window and door seals, waterproofing membranes, roofing applications, bitumen modification, safety equipment components, artificial turf, expansion joints, and road markings.</p>
<p>TPE and TPU elastomers are gaining traction due to their superior mechanical performance, increased durability, UV resistance, and enhanced aesthetics in construction projects. The growing adoption of bio-based elastomers is expected to create significant growth opportunities due to continuous advancements and rising demand for sustainable solutions. However, the higher cost compared to traditional materials might hinder market expansion.</p>
<p><strong>COVID-19 Impact: A Temporary Setback</strong></p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic's restrictive measures, including lockdowns and social distancing, initially caused disruptions in the construction industry and limited the availability of non-medical products. This led to decreased spending on construction projects and delays in project completion.</p>
<p><strong>Asia Pacific Leads the Construction Elastomer Charge</strong></p>
<p>Regionally, the Asia Pacific market is forecast to dominate due to the resurgence of residential construction in China, India, and Southeast Asian nations. Global elastomer manufacturers are strategically setting up production facilities in the APAC region to strengthen their market presence. India, being the world's largest construction market, is also a major consumer of construction elastomers. Additionally, supportive government regulations promoting the use of bio-based alternatives over plastics are expected to contribute to market growth in North America.</p>
