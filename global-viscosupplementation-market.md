<p><strong>Viscosupplementation: A Treatment for Osteoarthritis</strong></p>
<p>Viscosupplementation is a treatment for osteoarthritis, a condition where the knee joint deteriorates. In this procedure, a thick fluid called hyaluronate is injected into the joint. While it doesn't cure osteoarthritis, hyaluronate is believed to improve lubrication, reduce pain, enhance mobility, and allow for a more active lifestyle. It's typically used only after other treatments have failed to provide relief. The process usually involves three to five injections, spaced a week apart. Some common side effects include temporary pain, swelling, redness, and fluid buildup around the injection site.</p>
<p><strong>Factors Driving Market Growth</strong></p>
<p>The market is expected to grow due to several factors. Increased spending on research and innovation in viscosupplementation is anticipated to fuel market expansion. Additionally, established and emerging companies are actively pursuing strategies like collaborations and product development to solidify their positions. However, challenges exist as well. Limited product penetration in underdeveloped nations hinders overall growth.</p>
<p><strong>Lucrative Opportunities in Sports Medicine</strong></p>
<p>On the other hand, the growing use of viscosupplementation for sports injuries presents lucrative opportunities. Leading players are heavily focused on product development, scientific advancements, and expanding their capacities to capture a larger market share.</p>
<p><strong>COVID-19 Impact and Market Recovery</strong></p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the market. Lockdowns disrupted business operations and logistics, leading to labor shortages and product scarcity. However, some companies used this time to develop and promote new products. While the pandemic caused disruption across various sectors, the viscosupplementation market had been experiencing strong growth prior to the outbreak.</p>
