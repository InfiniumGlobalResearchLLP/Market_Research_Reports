<p><strong>Understanding Prostate Cancer</strong></p>
<p>Prostate cancer is a serious concern, arising as a malignant tumor in the male reproductive system. While some cases are benign, others can metastasize and become life-threatening. Typically affecting men over 50, prostate cancer is linked to genetics, red meat heavy diets, and environmental factors affecting male hormones. In the US alone, it's the most common cancer besides skin cancer.</p>
